# <HDMI Cec> Binding

Bidning to control devices connected via HDMI using CEC protocol. For example if you have a Raspebrry Pi 3 connected to a AV Receiver or TV, you can control other devices connected that support CEC. This is ideal for Sony PlayStation 4 which can't be turned on via IR, or Amazon Fire TV (stick/tv/cube) devices that use BT remotes.

## Supported Things

It should support devices which support CEC. See [libcec supported devices](http://libcec.pulse-eight.com/Vendor/Support) for a list)

## Discovery

This version supports manual discovery. You can invoke discovery via the Refresh link in Paper UI. It will invoke device discovery on the CEC bus. This can take 30s to switch on and enumerate the devices so is not suitable for continuous background refresh.

## Binding Configuration

The binding requires LibCEC to be installed and configured. 

```
// Things file for Raspberry Pi3
Bridge hdmicec:bridge:local [ cecClientPath="/usr/bin/cec-client", comPort="RPI"] 
```

For Raspberry Pi, add the openhab user to the video group.
```
sudo adduser openhab video
```

## Thing Configuration

Things need to be configured with the deviceIndex (a hex number) and address of the form n.n.n.n - these are found with the discovery process. Currently all devices are pulled in, regardless of type (TV, audio, player, recoreder), and treated as the same device type. 

## Channels

activeSource will send a signal to the target device to tell it to become active. This should switch it on, and configure the correct path through AV equipment to show the source.
remoteButton will send a button down and up command to a thing. For example from the console you can use
```
smarthome:send hdmicec_equipment_local_Unknown_FireTVCube_remoteButton down
```
to send a down button to the device (in this case a Fire TV Cube). The remote support is dumb, you can try sending any command to any device.
