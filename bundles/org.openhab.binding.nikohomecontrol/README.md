# Niko Home Control Binding

The Niko Home Control binding integrates with a [Niko Home Control](http://www.nikohomecontrol.be/) system through a Niko Home Control IP-interface or Niko Home Control Connected Controller.

The binding supports both Niko Home Control I and Niko Home Control II.

For Niko Home Control I, the binding has been tested with a Niko Home Control IP-interface (550-00508). This IP-interface provides access on the LAN.
The binding does not require a Niko Home Control Gateway (550-00580), but does work with it in the LAN. It will not make a remote connection.
It has also been confirmed to work with the Niko Home Control Connected Controller (550-00003) in a Niko Home Control I installation.

For Niko Home Control II, the binding requires the Niko Home Control Connected Controller (550-00003). The installation does not need to be 'connected' (registered on the Niko Home Control website), and will work stricly in the LAN.

For Niko Home Control I, the binding exposes all actions from the Niko Home Control System that can be triggered from the smartphone/tablet interface, as defined in the Niko Home Control I programming software.
For Niko Home Control II, the binding exposes all actions made visible in a touch profile, as configured in the Niko Home Control II programming software.
No actual Niko Touchscreen is required in the installation.

Supported device types are switches, dimmers and rollershutters or blinds and thermostats.
Niko Home Control alarm and notice messages are retrieved and made available in the binding.

## Supported Things

The Niko Home Control Controller is represented as a bridge in the binding.
Connected to a bridge, the Niko Home Control Binding supports alloff actions, on/off actions (e.g. for lights or groups of lights), dimmers, rollershutters or blinds and thermostats.

## Binding Configuration

The bridge representing the Niko Home Control IP-interface needs to be added first in the things file or through Paper UI.
A bridge can be auto-discovered or created manually.
An auto-discovered bridge will have an IP-address parameter automatically filled with the current IP-address of the IP-interface.
This IP-address for the discovered bridge will automatically update when the IP-address of the IP-interface changes.

The IP-address and port can be set when manually creating the bridge.

If the IP-address is set on a manually created bridge, no attempt will be made to discover the correct IP-address.
You are responsible to force a fixed IP address on the Niko Home Control IP-interface through settings in your DHCP server.

For Niko Home Control I, the port is set to 8000 by default and should match the port used by the Niko Home Control I IP-interface or Niko Home Control I Connected Controller.
For Niko Home Control II, the port is set to 8883 by default and should match the secure MQTT port used by the Niko Home Control II Connected Controller.

For Niko Home Control I, no further bridge configuration is required when using auto-discovery.

The Niko Home Control II bridge has extra required parameters for the touch profile and password.
Note that the password cannot be empty.
Therefore, a password needs to be set in the Niko Home Control II programming software for the used touch profile.

An optional refresh interval will be used to restart the bridge at regular intervals (every 300 minutes by default).
Restarting the bridge at regular times improves the connection stability and avoids loss of connection. It can be turned off completely by setting the parameter to 0.

## Discovery

A discovery scan will first discover the Niko Home Control IP-interface or Niko Home Control Connected Controller in the network as a bridge.
Default parameters will be used.
Note that this may fail to find the correct Niko Home Control IP-interface when there are multiple IP-interfaces in the network, or when traffic to port 10000 on the openHAB server is blocked.

When the Niko Home Control bridge is added as a thing, from the discovery inbox or manually, system information will be read from the Niko Home Control Controller and will be put in the bridge properties, visible through Paper UI.

Subsequently, all defined actions that can be triggered from a smartphone/tablet in the Niko Home Control I system, respectively actions attached to a touch profile in the Niko Home Control II system,  will be discovered and put in the inbox.
It is possible to trigger a manual scan for things on the Niko Home Control bridge.
Note that Niko Home Control II will require the touch profile and password parameters to be set on the bridge before the scan for actions can succeed.
The bridge will remain offline as long as these parameters are not set.

If the Niko Home Control system has locations configured, these will be copied to thing locations and grouped as such in PaperUI.
Locations can subsequently be changed through the thing location parameter in PaperUI.

## Thing Configuration

Besides using PaperUI to manually configure things or adding automatically discovered things through PaperUI, you can add thing definitions in the things file.

The Thing configuration for the **bridge** uses the following syntax:

For Niko Home Control I:

```
Bridge nikohomecontrol:bridge:<bridgeId> [ addr="<IP-address of IP-interface>", port=<listening port>,
                                           refresh=<Refresh interval> ]
```

`bridgeId` can have any value.

`addr` is the fixed Niko Home Control IP-interface or Connected Controller address and is required.
`port` will be the port used to connect and is 8000 by default.
`refresh` is the interval to restart the communication in minutes (300 by default), if 0 or omitted the connection will not restart at regular intervals.

For Niko Home Control II:

```
Bridge nikohomecontrol:bridge2:<bridgeId> [ addr="<IP-address of IP-interface>", port=<listening port>,
                                           profile=<touch profile>, password=<password>,
                                           refresh=<Refresh interval> ]
```

`bridgeId` can have any value.

`addr` is the fixed Niko Home Connected Controller address and is required.
`port` will be the port used to connect and is 8883 by default.
`profile` is the name of the touch profile configured in the Niko Home Control II programming software to be made available to openHAB.
`password` is the password for the touchprofile, cannot be empty.
`refresh` is the interval to restart the communication in minutes (300 by default), if 0 or omitted the connection will not restart at regular intervals.

The Thing configuration for **Niko Home Control actions** has the following syntax:

```
Thing nikohomecontrol:<thing type>:<bridgeId>:<thingId> "Label" @ "Location"
                        [ actionId=<Niko Home Control action ID>,
                          step=<dimmer increase/decrease step value> ]
```

or nested in the bridge configuration:

```
<thing type> <thingId> "Label" @ "Location" [ actionId=<Niko Home Control action ID>,
                         step=<dimmer increase/decrease step value> ]
```

The following action thing types are valid for the configuration:

```
pushButton, onOff, dimmer, blind
```

`pushButton` types are used to map directly to stateless actions in the Niko Home Control system, such as All Off actions.
Discovery will identify All Off actions and map them to `pushButton` things.

`thingId` can have any value, but will be set to the same value as the actionId parameter if discovery is used.

`"Label"` is an optional label for the thing.

`@ "Location"` is optional, and represents the location of the Thing. Auto-discovery would have assigned a value automatically.

For Niko Home Control I, the `actionId` parameter is the unique IP Interface Object ID (`ipInterfaceObjectId`) as automatically assigned in the Niko Home Control Controller when programming the Niko Home Control system using the Niko Home Control I programming software.
It is not directly visible in the Niko Home Control programming or user software, but will be detected and automatically set by openHAB discovery.
For textual configuration, you can manually retrieve it from the content of the .nhcp configuration file created by the programming software.
Open the file with an unzip tool to read it's content.

For Niko Home Control II, the `actionId` parameter is a unique ID for the action in the controller. It can only be auto-discovered.
If you want to define the action through textual configuration, the easiest way is to first do discovery on the bridge to get the correct `actionId` to use in the textual configuration.
Discover and add the thing you want to add.
Note down the `actionId` parameter from the thing, remove it before adding it again through textual configuration, with the same `actionId`parameter.
Alternatively the `actionId`can be retrieved from the configuration file. The file contains a SQLLite database. The database contains a table `Action` with column `FifthplayId` corresponding to the required `actionId`parameter.

The `step` parameter is only available for dimmers.
It sets a step value for dimmer increase/decrease actions. The parameter is optional and set to 10 by default.

The Thing configuration for **Niko Home Control thermostats** has the following syntax:

```
Thing nikohomecontrol:thermostat:<bridgeId>:<thingId> "Label" @ "Location"
                        [ thermostatId=<Niko Home Control thermostat ID> ]
```

or nested in the bridge configuration:

```
thermostat <thingId> "Label" @ "Location" [ thermostatId=<Niko Home Control thermostat ID> ]
```

`thingId` can have any value, but will be set to the same value as the thermostatId parameter if discovery is used.

`"Label"` is an optional label for the Thing.

`@ "Location"` is optional, and represents the location of the thing. Auto-discovery would have assigned a value automatically.

The `thermostatId` parameter is the unique ip Interface Object ID as automatically assigned in the Niko Home Control Controller I when programming the Niko Home Control system using the Niko Home Control programming software.
It is not directly visible in the Niko Home Control programming or user software, but will be detected and automatically set by openHAB discovery.
For textual configuration, it can be retrieved from the .nhcp configuration file.

For Niko Home Control II, the `thermostatId` parameter is a unique ID for the action in the controller. It can only be auto-discovered.
If you want to define the action through textual configuration, you may first need to do discovery on the bridge to get the correct `thermostatId` to use in the textual configuration.

The `overruleTime` parameter is used to set the standard overrule duration when you set a new setpoint without providing an overrule duration.
The default value is 60 minutes.

## Channels

For thing type `pushButton` the supported channel is `button`.
OnOff command types are supported.
For this channel, `autoupdate="false"` is set by default.
This will stop the linked item state from updating.

For thing type `onOff` the supported channel is `switch`.
OnOff command types are supported.

For thing type `dimmer` the supported channel is `brightness`.
OnOff, IncreaseDecrease and Percent command types are supported.
Note that sending an ON command will switch the dimmer to the value stored when last turning the dimmer off, or 100% depending on the configuration in the Niko Home Control Controller.
This can be changed with the Niko Home Control programming software.

For thing type `blind` the supported channel is `rollershutter`. UpDown, StopMove and Percent command types are supported.

For thing type `thermostat` the supported channels are `measured`, `mode`, `setpoint`, `overruletime` and `demand`.
`measured` gives the current temperature in QuantityType<Temperature>, allowing for different temperature units.
This channel is read only.
`mode` can be set and shows the current thermostat mode.
Allowed values are 0 (day), 1 (night), 2 (eco), 3 (off), 4 (cool), 5 (prog 1), 6 (prog 2), 7 (prog 3). If mode is set, the `setpoint` temperature will return to its standard value from the mode.
`setpoint` can be set and shows the current thermostat setpoint value in QuantityType<Temperature>.
When updating `setpoint`, it will overrule the temperature setpoint defined by the thermostat mode for `overruletime` duration.
`overruletime` is used to set the total duration to apply the setpoint temperature set in the setpoint channel before the thermostat returns to the setting in its mode.
`demand` is a number indicating of the system is actively heating/cooling.
The value will be 1 for heating, -1 for cooling and 0 if not heating or cooling.
Note that cooling in NHC I is set by the binding, and will incorrectly show cooling demand when the system does not have cooling capabilities.

The bridge has two trigger channels `alarm` and `notice`.
It can be used as a trigger to rules.
The event message is the alarm or notice text coming from Niko Home Control.

## Limitations

The binding has been tested with a Niko Home Control I IP-interface (550-00508) and the Niko Home Control Connected Controller (550-00003) for Niko Home Control I and Niko Home Control II.

The action events implemented are limited to onOff, dimmer, allOff, scenes, PIR and rollershutter or blinds.
Other actions have not been implemented.
It is not possible to tilt the slates of venetian blinds.

Beyond action and thermostat events, the Niko Home Control communication also supports electricity, gas and water usage data.
Niko Home Control II also supports 3rd party devices.
All of this has not been implemented.
